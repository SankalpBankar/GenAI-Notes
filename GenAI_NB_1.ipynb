            "2. **International Career:** He made his international debut in 2004 and quickly established himself as a valuable asset to the Indian cricket team.\n",
            "3. **Wicket-Keeping and Batting:** As you mentioned, Dhoni is widely regarded as one of the most prolific wicket-keeping batsmen in international cricket. He was also known for his ability to finish off matches with his aggressive batting style.\n",
            "4. **Captaincy Career:** Dhoni was appointed captain of the Indian cricket team in limited-overs formats (ODIs and T20Is) in 2007 and in Test cricket in 2008. He led the team to numerous victories, including the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2010 T20 World Cup, and the 2011 ODI World Cup.\n",
            "5. **Trophy Wins:** Under his captaincy, India won a record 15 trophies, including the World Cup, Asia Cup, and multiple Champions Trophy titles.\n",
            "6. **Retirement:** Dhoni retired from international cricket in August 2014, but continued to play domestic cricket and for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n",
            "7. **Legacy:** MS Dhoni is celebrated for his leadership, vision, and incredible cricketing abilities. He has been a source of inspiration to countless young cricketers and fans around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dhoni is often credited with revamping India's cricket culture, making it competitive and dynamic, and paving the way for future generations of Indian cricketers. His legacy continues to shape Indian cricket to this day.\n",
            "That's mostly correct, but some information might need an update and clarification. \n",
            "\n",
            "Virat Kohli was indeed born on 5 November 1988. However, it's worth noting that he is currently the former captain of the Indian national team, he stepped down as captain of the Test team in 2021, and then also stepped down as captain of the ODI and T20I teams in January 2022.\n",

            "1. Rohit Sharma's retirement update: The statement mentions that Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from T20Is after India's victory at the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup. However, this information might not be accurate since my cut-off knowledge date is in December 2023. I may not have information beyond that date.\n",

            "\n",
            "- Virat Kohli has also been a successful captain of the Indian national cricket team. He led the side to numerous victories and was known for his strong leadership skills.\n",
            "- Kohli has been the recipient of several awards and recognitions, including the ICC Cricketer of the Year award in 2012 and the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for the ICC Cricketer of the Year in 2016.\n",
            "- He has been one of the most successful batsmen in the history of international cricket, breaking numerous records and achieving numerous milestones throughout his career.\n",
            "- Kohli has led the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and has been a key player for the team, representing his hometown team in Bangalore.\n",
            "- He is also the captain of the Delhi cricket team in domestic tournaments.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's worth noting that there are some minor discrepancies between the information you provided and the information I have. However, these points give a general overview of Virat Kohli's career and achievements.\n",
            "It seems you're attempting to update the information about Rohit Gurunath Sharma. However, there is an issue with the given information about a victory in the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup. My knowledge cutoff is 01 December 2023, and I do not have information on future events such as a 2024 T20 World Cup, or any subsequent retirement announcement of Rohit Gurunath Sharma from T20Is, given that information would have occurred after my knowledge cutoff. \n",
            "\n",
            "But for the record, up until my knowledge cutoff, Rohit Gurunath Sharma remains an Indian international cricketer, the captain of the India national team in ODIs, a former captain in Tests and T20Is, widely regarded as one of the greatest opening batters, and one of the best batsmen of his generation.\n"

            "\n",
            "In mathematics and computer science, a **vector** is a mathematical object that represents a quantity with both magnitude and direction. In the context of NLP and ML, vectors are used to represent words, documents, or other text-based data in a high-dimensional space.\n",

            "Think of a vector as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension represents a unique aspect of the data. For example, if we represent words as vectors, each dimension might correspond to a unique word or concept in the language.\n",

            "Summary: The economy of India is a developing mixed economy with a notable public sector in strategic sectors. It is the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP); on a per capita income basis, India ranked 136th by GDP (nominal) and 119th by GDP (PPP). From independence in 1947 until 1991, successive governments followed the Soviet model and promoted protectionist economic policies, with extensive Sovietization, state intervention, demand-side economics, natural resources, bureaucrat-driven enterprises and economic regulation. This is characterised as dirigism, in the form of the Licence Raj. The end of the Cold War and an acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 led to the adoption of a broad economic liberalisation in India and indicative planning. India has about 1,900 public sector companies, with the Indian state having complete control and ownership of railways and highways. The Indian government has major control over banking, insurance, farming, fertilizers and chemicals, airports, essential utilities. The state also exerts substantial control over digitalization, telecommunication, supercomputing, space, port and shipping industries, which were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s but has seen the emergence of key corporate players.\n",
            "Nearly 70% of India's GDP is driven by domestic consumption; the country remains the world's third-largest consumer market. Aside private consumption, India's GDP is also fueled by government spending, investments, and exports. In 2022, India was the world's 10th-largest importer and the 8th-largest exporter. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995. It ranks 63rd on the ease of doing business index and 40th on the Global Competitiveness Index. India has one of the world's highest number of billionaires along with extreme income inequality.  Economists and social scientists often consider India a welfare state. India's overall social welfare spending stood at 8.6% of GDP in 2021-22, which is much lower than the average for OECD nations. With 586 million workers, the Indian labour force is the world's second-largest. Despite having some of the longest working hours, India has one of the lowest workforce productivity levels in the world. Economists say that due to structural economic problems, India is experiencing jobless economic growth.\n",
            "During the Great Recession, the economy faced a mild slowdown. India endorsed Keynesian policy and initiated stimulus measures (both fiscal and monetary) to boost growth and generate demand. In subsequent years, economic growth revived.\n",
            "In 2021–22, the foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was $82 billion. The leading sectors for FDI inflows were the Finance, Banking, Insurance and R&D. India has free trade agreements with several nations and blocs, including ASEAN, SAFTA, Mercosur, South Korea, Japan, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and several others which are in effect or under negotiating stage.\n",
            "The service sector makes up more than 50% of GDP and remains the fastest growing sector, while the industrial sector and the agricultural sector employs a majority of the labor force. The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange are some of the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalisation. India is the world's sixth-largest manufacturer, representing 2.6% of global manufacturing output. Nearly 65% of India's population is rural, and contributes about 50% of India's GDP. India faces high unemployment, rising income inequality, and a drop in aggregate demand. India's gross domestic savings rate stood at 29.3% of GDP in 2022.\n",
